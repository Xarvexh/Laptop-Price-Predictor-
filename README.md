# Laptop-Price-Predictor-
This is a machine learning project where a dataset regarding laptop was taken from kaggle. The aim was to predict the price of laptops based on their specifications.
Here the dataset was firstly cleaned, integrated, transformed and later EDA was performed for detailed study of the correlation between various specs of laptops. 
After data cleaning, the dataset was split into train and test data. 
Several machine learning algorithms are implemented for predicting laptop prices. The algorithms include but are not limited to:
- Linear Regression
- Random Forest
- Support Vector Machine (SVM)
- Gradient Boosting
The performance of each algorithm is evaluated using metrics such as Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Mean Squared Error (MSE), and R-squared.

The project was 65% accurate and the efficiency will increase with the number of trials. 
The project includes a user-friendly UI that allows users to input laptop details through dropdown menus. The UI leverages the trained machine learning models to predict the laptop price based on the provided information.
